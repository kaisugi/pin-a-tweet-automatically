# pin-a-tweet-automatically

As of May 2021, the function to pin tweets has not been released as an API.  
So I wrote a script to automatically pin the specific ID's tweet using Puppeteer.

Don't forget to enter your user name and password in the `.env` file before using this script.

## Usage

```
TWEETID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX node pin-a-tweet-automatically.js
```
